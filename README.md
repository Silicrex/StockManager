# Personal stock trade stats
Just a little program I wrote for practice. Lets you manually input activity, and has some primitive, text-based statistics/convenience features.

Also testing PyCharm's native Git integration! Yay!

Could be used as a simulator too, I suppose.

The main feature I felt was unique (idk if it really is) is the ability to sort stocks by all-time best performance.

There's a way to account for fees and all of that, but it's finnicky right now. Will work on a way to make it more automatic.
